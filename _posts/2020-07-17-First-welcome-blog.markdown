## here I will inform you how to make a page like this
## but first tell me a bit about yourself!
## I will tell you what you need to know and how to learn them
## You might think that when there is wordpress why this?
## Heard of opensource ? 
## Free, scalable, enogh, easy to learn and maintain.
## Do you know any city or country or even vilage that give you free land on earth?! it is impossible?!! but here you have a free and also open source space to explore, develop and anything else you can think of. 
## If you are a fan of big corporations and superstars and also 
##    vegeterian and anti-capitalism! and so on.
## Do not waste your time here and go waste your time somewhere else
## Feel free to ask me any question

```bash
pip install foobar
```


Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets for Python:

{% highlight python %}
for i in range(10):
  print(i**2)
{% endhighlight %}
